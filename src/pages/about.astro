      <h2>Our Standards</h2>
      <div class="author-box">
        <h3>Editorial Independence</h3>
        <p>We maintain strict editorial independence in our reviews. While some DJ services may be affiliate partners, this never influences our ratings or recommendations. We only recommend DJs we would confidently hire for our own events.</p>

        <h3>Regular Updates</h3>
        <p>The DJ industry changes fast. We continuously update our reviews, pricing information, and rankings to ensure you have the most current information when making your decision.</p>

        <h3>Local Expertise</h3>
        <p>We focus exclusively on the Huntsville area and surrounding communities. This allows us to provide detailed, locally-relevant information you won't find on national platforms.</p>
