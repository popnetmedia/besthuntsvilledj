    // General Questions
    {
      category: "General Questions",
      question: "What's the average cost to rent an RV in Huntsville?",
      answer: "RV rental prices in Huntsville typically range from $150 to $300 per day, depending on the size and type of RV. Class A motorhomes are generally more expensive ($250-400/day), while smaller camper vans start around $100-150/day. Weekly rentals offer better value at $900-$2,100 per week. Factor in additional costs like insurance ($25-40/day), mileage overages ($0.35-0.45/mile), and generator usage ($3-5/hour)."
    },
    {
      category: "General Questions",
      question: "Do I need a special license to rent an RV in Huntsville?",
      answer: "No special license required in Alabama. A standard driver's license is sufficient for RVs under 26,000 lbs (all rental RVs). Alabama DMV doesn't require CDL for personal RV use. Rental companies typically require: age 25+, valid license held for 3+ years, and clean driving record. International visitors need a valid passport and International Driving Permit (IDP) plus home country license."
    },
    {
      category: "General Questions",
      question: "What's the best time of year to rent an RV in Huntsville?",
      answer: "Spring (March-May) and fall (September-November) offer the best RV rental conditions in Huntsville. Temperatures range from 60-80°F, perfect for exploring Alabama state parks. Summer (June-August) brings heat and humidity (85-95°F) but great for lake activities at Lake Guntersville and DeGray Lake. Avoid late spring for severe weather season. Winter (December-February) offers the lowest rates ($100-140/day) with mild temperatures, though some campgrounds have limited services."
    },
    {
      category: "General Questions",
      question: "Can I rent an RV in Huntsville for a one-way trip?",
      answer: "Yes, one-way RV rentals from Huntsville are available but limited. Most popular routes: Huntsville to Nashville, TN ($200-300 fee), Huntsville to Atlanta, GA ($250-350 fee), or Huntsville to Birmingham, AL ($350-500 fee). Cruise America's Huntsville location offers nationwide one-way options. Peer-to-peer platforms rarely allow one-way from Huntsville. Book 60+ days ahead for one-way availability, especially during peak season."
    },
    {
      category: "General Questions",
      question: "How far in advance should I book an RV rental in Huntsville?",
      answer: "For peak season (June-August) and major holidays, book 2-3 months in advance to ensure availability and better rates. Spring and fall shoulder seasons can be booked 4-6 weeks ahead. Last-minute rentals (within 2 weeks) are sometimes available at discounted rates during off-peak periods, but selection will be limited. Early booking also gives you more time to plan your route and campground reservations."
    },
    {
      category: "General Questions",
      question: "Are pets allowed in RV rentals in Huntsville?",
      answer: "Pet policies vary by company and owner. Fireside RV Rental in Huntsville is pet-friendly with no extra fees. Cruise America typically allows pets with a $150-200 cleaning fee and proof of vaccinations. RVshare owners in the Huntsville area have varying policies - roughly 40-50% of listings are pet-friendly. Always disclose pets upfront as unauthorized pets can result in additional fees of $300-500 or loss of your security deposit."
    },
    {
      category: "General Questions",
      question: "What is included in my RV rental in Huntsville?",
      answer: "Standard inclusions typically cover: basic kitchen supplies (pots, pans, utensils), bedding for all sleeping areas, bathroom supplies, 150 free miles per day, basic insurance, and 24/7 roadside assistance. NOT included: generator usage ($3-5/hour or $30-50/day), additional mileage ($0.35-0.45/mile), upgraded insurance, cleaning fees ($75-150), propane refills, dump fees, and campground costs. Always confirm exact inclusions with your specific rental company."
    },
    // Pricing Questions
    {
      category: "Pricing Questions",
      question: "What hidden fees should I watch out for when renting an RV in Huntsville?",
      answer: "Common hidden fees include: generator usage ($3-5/hour), mileage overages ($0.35-0.45/mile beyond daily allowance), cleaning fees if returned dirty ($75-200), late return charges ($50-100/hour), propane refill if not returned full ($25-75), dump fees if not emptied ($50-100), tolls on routes to destinations, prep fees ($50-150), and early pickup/late drop-off fees ($25-50). Always ask for a complete fee breakdown before booking."
    },
    {
      category: "Pricing Questions",
      question: "How much does RV insurance cost in Huntsville?",
      answer: "Basic insurance included with most rentals covers liability. Supplemental insurance ranges from $25-40 per day for damage waiver coverage that reduces your deductible from $3,000-5,000 down to $500-1,000. Full comprehensive insurance costs $35-50/day with zero deductible. For a 7-day rental, expect to pay $175-350 for insurance. Some credit cards (Chase Sapphire Reserve, Amex Platinum) may provide coverage, but verify RV inclusion."
    },
    {
      category: "Pricing Questions",
      question: "What is the total cost to rent an RV in Huntsville for a week?",
      answer: "For a week-long rental, budget: Base rental $900-2,100 (Class B-C average), insurance $175-280, unlimited mileage upgrade $100-150 (optional), generator package $150-200, cleaning fee $75-125, propane/dump fees $50-100. Total: $1,450-3,000 depending on RV class and options. Add campground costs ($40-80/night x 7 = $280-560), fuel ($200-400), and food. Expect $2,200-4,500 all-in for a comfortable week-long trip."
    },
    {
      category: "Pricing Questions",
      question: "Do RV rental prices in Huntsville vary by season?",
      answer: "Yes, significantly. Peak summer rates (June-August): $150-250/day. Shoulder season (March-May, Sept-Nov): $125-180/day (20-30% savings). Off-season (Dec-Feb): $100-150/day (30-40% savings). Holiday weekends (Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day) command premium rates 30-40% above normal. Booking during shoulder season for popular Alabama destinations like Space Center and Tennessee River can save $400-600 on a week-long rental."
    },

      category: "Pricing Questions",

    // Booking Process
    {
      category: "Booking Process",
      question: "What documents do I need to rent an RV in Huntsville?",
      answer: "Required documents: Valid driver's license (held for 3-5 years depending on company), major credit card in driver's name (for security deposit), proof of insurance or agreement to purchase rental insurance, and government-issued photo ID.

    },
    {
      category: "Booking Process",
      question: "Can I pick up my RV rental at Huntsville International Airport (HSV)?",
      answer: "No rental companies operate directly at Huntsville International Airport, but several are within 25-40 minutes. Closest options: Fireside RV Rental in Huntsville (30 miles, 35-40 min), Cruise America in Huntsville metro area (25-30 miles), and various RVshare owners who may offer LIT airport delivery. Uber/Lyft to pickup locations costs $35-60. Most renters get a rental car for a day to pickup the RV and stock up on supplies at Walmart/Costco in the Huntsville area."
    },
    {
      category: "Booking Process",
      question: "What is the minimum rental period in Huntsville?",
      answer: "Most corporate rental companies require a minimum 3-5 day rental (some waive this off-season). Peer-to-peer platforms on RVshare and Outdoorsy often allow 1-2 night minimums, though nightly rates are higher. During peak summer season, many companies enforce 7-day minimums, especially over holiday weekends. Weekend-only rentals (Fri-Mon) may be available off-season but expect to pay premium daily rates."
    },
    {
      category: "Booking Process",
      question: "What happens if I need to cancel my RV rental in Huntsville?",
      answer: "Cancellation policies vary by company. Cruise America: Full refund if cancelled 30+ days before, 50% refund 15-29 days, no refund within 14 days. RVshare: Flexible (full refund up to 48 hours before), Moderate (full refund up to 7 days before), or Strict (full refund up to 30 days before) depending on owner. Travel insurance ($50-100) can protect against unforeseen circumstances. Always purchase cancellation insurance for peak season bookings."
    },
    {
      category: "Booking Process",
      question: "Can I add an additional driver to my RV rental?",
      answer: "Yes, most companies allow additional drivers but they must meet the same requirements (age 25+, valid license, 3-5 years experience). Additional driver fees range from free (spouse/domestic partner) to $5-15 per day for other drivers. All drivers must be present at pickup to complete paperwork and be added to insurance. Some peer-to-peer owners limit to 2 total drivers or charge higher fees."
    },
    // Local Regulations
    {
      category: "Local Regulations",
      question: "Where can I legally park my RV overnight in Huntsville?",
      answer: "Overnight RV parking options near Huntsville: 1) Monte Sano State Park in North Huntsville (full hookups, $30-40/night), 2) Madison County Nature Trail (Madison County, free dry camping), 3) Walmart in Madison allows overnight parking (call ahead), 4) Cracker Barrel in Huntsville (usually permitted), 5) Point Mallard Park Resort in Space Center (free for guests). Avoid street parking in Huntsville residential areas - prohibited and enforced. State parks require reservations."
    },
    {
      category: "Local Regulations",
      question: "What are the RV size restrictions in Huntsville?",
      answer: "Alabama state highways and interstates accommodate all standard RV sizes. Most bridges on I-565 and US-72 have 14+ foot clearance (standard RVs are 11-13 feet). Huntsville city streets can handle RVs up to 35 feet. State parks have varying limits: Space Center Gulpha Gorge (40 feet max), Monte Sano (30 feet at some sites), Crater of Diamonds (60 feet). Tennessee River has tight switchbacks - check specific campground restrictions. Always verify destination limits before booking."
    },
    {
      category: "Local Regulations",
      question: "Do I need any special permits to drive an RV in Alabama?",
      answer: "No special permits required for RVs under 26,000 lbs (most rentals). Alabama does not require non-commercial vehicle permits regardless of length. However, you may need: U.S. Space & Rocket Center entrance ($15-25 per vehicle), Alabama State Parks passes ($8 daily, $25 annual), Bankhead National Forest recreation passes ($5 per day), and America the Beautiful Pass ($80 annual for all federal lands). Towing a vehicle behind your RV requires supplemental braking systems per Alabama law."
    },
    {
      category: "Local Regulations",
      question: "What are Alabama's requirements for car seats in RVs?",
      answer: "Alabama law requires children under 8 years old to be in an appropriate car seat or booster seat in the rear seat. In RVs, children must be in seats with proper lap/shoulder belts - dinette and rear sofa seats often don't qualify. Most Class C and A motorhomes have 2-4 proper seatbelt positions for car seats. Verify available car seat positions before renting if traveling with young children. Rental companies don't provide car seats - bring your own."
    },
    {
      category: "Local Regulations",
      question: "Are there any driving restrictions for RVs in Huntsville?",
      answer: "Alabama RV driving restrictions: Most highways and interstates have no special RV restrictions. Speed limits: 55 mph on 2-lane highways, 70 mph on I-565/I-65 (no separate RV limit). Scenic Highway 431 through Appalachian foothills has steep grades and switchbacks - use low gears and pull-outs. Some downtown Huntsville parking garages prohibit RVs over 7 feet. No chain requirements (rarely snows). Avoid Huntsville residential streets with 'No Trucks' signs during rush hour."

              <p><strong>My Huntsville RV Story:</strong> I'll never forget pulling into Fireside RV Rental in Huntsville on a crisp October morning. My husband and I had just flown into Huntsville International Airport, picked up our rental car, and made the short 20-minute drive to pick up our first-ever RV rental in Rocket City—a gorgeous 28-foot Class C that would be our home for the next ten days exploring North Alabama. The moment we arrived, Dathan greeted us with genuine southern hospitality and two steaming cups of coffee. He didn't just hand us keys and rush us out the door; he spent nearly 90 minutes walking us through every cabinet, every switch, every quirk of the rig. He showed us how to level it properly on the uneven terrain at Monte Sano State Park, demonstrated the slide-out mechanism twice, and even wrote down his personal cell number "just in case." Before we left, Dathan pulled out a well-worn North Alabama map and circled his favorite hidden camping spots near Lake Guntersville and along the Tennessee River. He told us about a secret overlook at Monte Sano that tourists miss, recommended the best BBQ in Decatur, and gave us insider tips on avoiding crowds at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center. That week changed everything for us—we watched sunrise over the Tennessee River, explored the massive rockets at Space & Rocket Center, hiked Monte Sano's Bluffline Trail through morning mist, and camped under the stars at Lake Guntersville where we caught bass right from our site. The personalized service we received from Dathan at Fireside set the tone for the entire trip, and it's why I now insist on visiting local rental companies in person before recommending them. Since that first Huntsville pickup with Fireside, I've also tested RVs from RVshare owners in the area, logged over 2,600 miles on North Alabama backroads, and visited 11 state parks across Alabama and Tennessee—all to help you find the perfect rig for your Rocket City adventure.</p>

      <h2>Best Time to Rent & Visit Huntsville, Alabama</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">We've rented RVs from Huntsville in three different seasons, and timing makes a massive difference in both pricing and experience. Alabama's weather swings from 95°F summer heat to mild 50°F winter days, and understanding these patterns will save you hundreds while improving your trip.</p>

      <div class="season-box">
        <h3>🌸 Spring (March-May) - Peak Value Season</h3>
        <p>Spring is the sweet spot for Huntsville RV rentals. We picked up our Class C in mid-April and paid $135/day—35% less than summer rates. Temperatures hover between 60-80°F, perfect for exploring <a href={AUTHORITY_LINKS.nps.hotSprings} target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">U.S. Space & Rocket Center</a> (60 miles southwest) and <a href={AUTHORITY_LINKS.arkansasStateParks.pinnacleMountain} target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Monte Sano State Park</a> (15 miles west).</p>

        <p><strong>Peak Booking Period:</strong> Late March through mid-May sees increasing demand as Alabama wildflowers bloom. Book 4-6 weeks ahead for best selection. Dogwood blooms typically peak in early April around Space Center.</p>

        <p><strong>Watch Out:</strong> Late April through May is Alabama tornado season. We always check the <a href={AUTHORITY_LINKS.weather.nwsHuntsville} target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Weather Service Huntsville office</a> daily and ensure our RV has weather radio. Most rental companies include emergency protocols—ask during pickup.</p>

        <p><strong>Best Spring Destinations from Huntsville:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>U.S. Space & Rocket Center</strong> - 60 miles via US-72 W, historic bathhouses and hiking trails</li>
          <li><strong>Lake Guntersville</strong> - 90 miles via I-565 W, spring fishing for bass and crappie</li>
          <li><strong>Tennessee River</strong> - 150 miles via US-65 N, float season starts mid-April</li>
          <li><strong>Cathedral Caverns State Park</strong> - 80 miles via AL-9 N, stunning canyon views and Cedar Falls Trail</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="season-box">
        <h3>☀️ Summer (June-August) - Peak Season Pricing & Heat</h3>
        <p>Summer brings peak RV rental demand and peak heat. Expect 85-95°F days with 70% humidity. Daily rates jump to $180-225 for Class C motorhomes. We rented in early July once and the AC ran constantly—generator fuel added $40/day to our costs.</p>

        <p><strong>Peak Booking Period:</strong> Memorial Day through Labor Day, especially 4th of July week and Alabama school summer break (early June through mid-August). Book 8-10 weeks ahead or expect limited selection.</p>

        <p><strong>Summer Strategy:</strong> Focus on lake destinations where you can cool off. <a href={AUTHORITY_LINKS.arkansasStateParks.deGray} target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DeGray Lake</a> (75 miles via I-565 W) and Lake Guntersville offer swimming, boating, and air-conditioned visitor centers. Start driving early morning (6-8 AM) before temps peak.</p>

        <p><strong>Money-Saving Tip:</strong> Avoid the first week of June and last week of August when Huntsville schools are transitioning. We found 15-20% lower rates during these "shoulder weeks" within peak season.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="season-box">
        <h3>🍂 Fall (September-November) - Best Overall Experience</h3>
        <p>Fall is our favorite time to rent from Huntsville. Temperatures drop to comfortable 60-75°F, humidity disappears, and rates fall 20-30% from summer peaks. We rented a 27-foot Class C in late September for $145/day and had spectacular weather at Tennessee River.</p>

        <p><strong>Peak Booking Period:</strong> Early October is busiest due to fall foliage in the Smokies and Bankheads. Colors typically peak around October 15-25 in Space Center area. Book 6 weeks ahead for October weekends.</p>

        <p><strong>Fall Foliage Routes from Huntsville:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Talimena National Scenic Byway</strong> - 165 miles via I-565 W, peak colors mid-October</li>
          <li><strong>Ozark Highlands Scenic Byway</strong> - 200 miles via US-65 N, stunning ridge-top vistas</li>
          <li><strong>Alabama River Valley</strong> - 100 miles via I-65 W, Cathedral Caverns and Mount Nebo state parks</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Best Value Window:</strong> Early November after foliage peak but before Thanksgiving. We've found rates as low as $110-130/day for quality Class C motorhomes, and campgrounds are nearly empty.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="season-box">
        <h3>❄️ Winter (December-February) - Lowest Rates & Mild Weather</h3>
        <p>Alabama winters are surprisingly RV-friendly. Average temps sit at 40-55°F—chilly but manageable with good heating. We rented in mid-January for $95/day (60% less than summer!) and spent a week at Space Center enjoying the thermal baths without summer crowds.</p>

        <p><strong>Peak Booking Period:</strong> Very light demand except Thanksgiving week and Christmas-New Year's. Many local renters store RVs November-February, so inventory drops 30-40%. Book 2-3 weeks ahead, maximum.</p>

        <p><strong>Winter Advantages:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Space Center bathhouses are perfect in cold weather—no crowds, easy parking</li>
          <li>State park campgrounds offer electric hookups and winterized facilities</li>
          <li>Wildlife viewing improves (deer, eagles at lakes, waterfowl at refuges)</li>
          <li>Many campgrounds offer monthly rates ($800-1,200) for snowbirds heading south</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Watch Out:</strong> Ice storms can hit North Alabama in January-February. We always add the comprehensive insurance ($35-40/day) for winter rentals and avoid travel when ice is forecast. Roads around Huntsville and Birmingham clear quickly, but rural highways to state parks can stay icy 24-48 hours.</p>

      <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> For maximum value, rent in November, January, or February. For best weather and experience, choose late September through mid-October or April through mid-May. Avoid July-August unless you're committed to lake destinations with water access.</p>

        <h3>Money-Saving Tips for {cityData.name} RV Rentals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Book 2-3 months early:</strong> Save 10-20% off peak season rates</li>
          <li><strong>Rent during shoulder season:</strong> Spring/fall rates are 20-30% lower than summer</li>
          <li><strong>Consider weekly rates:</strong> Daily rate drops 15-25% on week-long rentals</li>
          <li><strong>Skip the generator package:</strong> If staying at campgrounds with hookups, you won't need it</li>
          <li><strong>Calculate mileage carefully:</strong> Unlimited mileage upgrade pays for itself at 500+ extra miles</li>
          <li><strong>Return clean:</strong> Spend $50 on a self-service wash vs. $150-200 cleaning fee</li>
          <li><strong>Empty tanks yourself:</strong> Dump stations charge $5-15 vs. $50-100 company fee</li>
          <li><strong>Check peer-to-peer platforms:</strong> RVshare/Outdoorsy often beat corporate rates by 15-30%</li>
          <li><strong>Travel mid-week:</strong> Some owners offer lower rates for Tuesday-Thursday pickups</li>

      <p><strong>Our Verdict:</strong> Rent from Huntsville if you're starting a road trip to Alabama destinations (Space Center, Tennessee River, Smokies). You'll save $200-300 on a week rental and skip city traffic. Choose Birmingham only if you're flying in without a car and need maximum fleet selection.</p>

      <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> Last October, we compared identical 27-foot Class C rentals. Huntsville (Fireside RV): $145/day with unlimited miles. Birmingham (national chain): $185/day with 150-mile daily limit. We drove 800 miles that week to U.S. Space Space Center, Tennessee River, and Cathedral Caverns Rocket Center, Lake Guntersville, and Monte Sano. Huntsville saved us $280 in rental fees plus $190 in mileage overages. Total savings: $470.</p>

      <h3>Huntsville vs. Madison - Neighboring City Comparison</h3>
      <p>Madison is Huntsville's neighboring city, just 10 miles west. Both offer RV rentals, but there are key differences we discovered after testing both.</p>

      <div class="comparison-grid">
        <div class="comparison-card">
          <h4>Huntsville Advantages</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>More Rental Options:</strong> Larger selection with Fireside RV and 480+ RVshare vehicles vs. Madison's smaller inventory</li>
            <li><strong>Better Airport Access:</strong> Huntsville International (HSV) is 10 miles from Huntsville vs. 20 miles from Madison</li>
            <li><strong>More Amenities:</strong> Better access to Space & Rocket Center (15 min), downtown attractions, and restaurants</li>
            <li><strong>Easier Navigation:</strong> Main rental locations on Memorial Parkway with easy I-565 access</li>
            <li><strong>More Services:</strong> More RV service centers, propane refill stations, and dump stations</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="comparison-card">
          <h4>Madison Advantages</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Slightly Lower Prices:</strong> 5-10% cheaper on some peer-to-peer listings</li>
            <li><strong>Less Traffic:</strong> Quieter roads, easier to navigate for first-time RV drivers</li>
            <li><strong>Quick Lake Access:</strong> Closer to Wheeler Lake (15 miles vs. 25 from Huntsville)</li>
            <li><strong>Suburban Feel:</strong> More residential, peaceful pickup experience vs. busy Huntsville corridors</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Rent from Huntsville for better selection, airport access, and amenities. Choose Madison only if you find a great RVshare deal and prefer quieter suburban pickups.</p>

      <h3>Huntsville vs. Decatur - North Alabama Gateway</h3>
      <p>Decatur is 25 miles west along the Tennessee River. We rented there for a lake trip and learned some key differences.</p>

      </table>

      <p><strong>Our Take:</strong> Decatur makes sense if you're exclusively exploring Northwest Alabama and the Tennessee River. For a balanced Alabama trip hitting Space Center, Monte Sano, and Bankhead Lakes, Huntsville's central location wins. Plus, you'll save $100-200 on a week rental and avoid Razorback football rental shortages.</p>

      <h3>Huntsville vs. Atlanta, GA - Regional Comparison</h3>
      <p>Many travelers flying into Memphis consider renting there and driving into Alabama. We've done both routes.</p>

          <h4>Why Choose Huntsville Over Memphis:</h4>

            <li><strong>Shorter Drive to Space Center:</strong> 60 miles from Huntsville vs. 210 miles from Memphis</li>

            <li><strong>Competitive Pricing:</strong> Similar rates but better Alabama destination access</li>

            <li><strong>Better Flights:</strong> Memphis (MEM) sometimes has cheaper fares than Birmingham (LIT)</li>

            <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Platforms:</strong> Message owners directly, especially for longer rentals (7+ days)</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Week Rentals:</strong> Negotiate monthly rate (typically 30-40% off daily rate)</li>

            <h3>Not Accounting for Birmingham Traffic in Pickup/Dropoff Timing</h3>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Scheduling pickup at 8am or dropoff at 5pm during weekdays and hitting Birmingham rush hour traffic (especially on US-72 and I-565).</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Schedule pickups after 9:30am or between 1-3pm. For dropoffs, aim for before 3pm or after 6:30pm. Weekend pickups avoid this issue entirely.</p>
            <p><strong>Cost Impact:</strong> Can add 45-90 minutes to your travel time from the airport, potentially causing late pickup fees ($50-100/hour) or rushing your final day.</p>

            <h3>Underestimating the Size/Driving Difficulty</h3>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> First-time renters booking a 35-foot Class A motorhome and attempting to drive scenic Highway 431 through the Appalachian foothills or navigate downtown Huntsville streets.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Start with a Class B van or smaller Class C (under 25 feet) for your first rental. Save big rigs for after you have experience with Alabama mountain roads.</p>
            <p><strong>Cost Impact:</strong> Damaged awnings, scraped sides, or getting stuck can cost $500-5,000 in repairs. Not worth the stress.</p>

            <h3>Skipping the Pre-Trip Inspection Video</h3>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Rushing through pickup and not documenting existing damage with photos/video, then being charged for pre-existing issues.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Spend 15-20 minutes taking detailed photos/video of every surface before leaving the lot. Document any scratches, dents, or interior issues with the staff present.</p>
            <p><strong>Cost Impact:</strong> Could save you $200-2,000 in disputed damage charges. Always document everything.</p>

            <h3>Not Testing Everything Before Leaving</h3>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Driving away without testing AC, generator, water pump, slideouts, awning, stove - then discovering issues at your first campground.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Spend 30 minutes testing every system before leaving the rental facility. If anything doesn't work, document it immediately or request a different RV.</p>
            <p><strong>Cost Impact:</strong> Being stuck with a non-functional AC during Alabama summer heat and humidity is miserable. Prevention is everything.</p>

            <h3>Forgetting About Height Clearances</h3>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Driving a 12.5-foot tall RV under a 12-foot clearance bridge or into a low parking structure in downtown Huntsville.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Know your RV's height (it's posted inside). Use RV-specific GPS apps (RV Life, Roadtrippers) that avoid low clearances. Never trust your car's GPS.</p>
            <p><strong>Cost Impact:</strong> Roof damage from clearance strikes starts at $3,000 and can total the RV. You'll pay your full deductible ($1,000-5,000).</p>

            <h3>Not Calculating Total Mileage</h3>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Accepting 100 free miles per day, then driving to Tennessee River and back (280 miles) and hitting overage charges.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Calculate your total expected miles before booking. If over 500 miles beyond included, buy unlimited mileage upgrade ($100-200) - it pays for itself.</p>
            <p><strong>Cost Impact:</strong> Mileage overages at $0.40/mile add up fast. A 1,000-mile trip could cost an extra $400 if you don't plan ahead.</p>

            <h3>Booking Summer Without Understanding Alabama Heat and Humidity</h3>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Renting in July-August without verifying AC works perfectly or understanding generator requirements for Alabama' high heat and humidity (85-95°F with 70%+ humidity).</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Test AC extensively before leaving. For Alabama summer trips, budget for generator usage ($35-45/day unlimited) or plan to stay at full-hookup campgrounds only.</p>
            <p><strong>Cost Impact:</strong> Generator costs can add $245-315 to a week-long trip. Plus the misery of being hot and humid with no AC relief.</p>

            <h3>Ignoring Campground Reservations</h3>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Renting an RV during peak season without booking campgrounds in advance, then struggling to find places to stay.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Book popular Alabama state parks (Space Center Gulpha Gorge, Tennessee River, DeGray Lake) 3-6 months in advance when you book your RV. Have backup options planned.</p>
            <p><strong>Cost Impact:</strong> Last-minute private RV parks charge $50-80/night vs. $25-40 for advance-booked state park spots. Could add $150-280 to a week-long trip.</p>

            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Returning RV with full gray/black water tanks and assuming the company will handle it.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Find dump stations near rental location (use apps like AllStays). Dump tanks within 10 miles of dropoff. Costs $5-15 vs. company fee.</p>
            <p><strong>Cost Impact:</strong> Company dump fees range from $50-100. DIY dumping costs $5-15. Save $45-95 with 15 minutes of work.</p>

            <h3>Not Reading Peer-to-Peer Reviews Carefully</h3>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Booking based on price alone without reading reviews, especially recent ones, and ending up with a problematic RV or difficult owner.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Read all reviews from the last 6 months. Look for patterns (mentions of mechanical issues, cleanliness, owner responsiveness). Filter reviews by Birmingham/Huntsville area pickup location.</p>
            <p><strong>Cost Impact:</strong> A breakdown 150 miles from Huntsville could cost you days of your trip plus emergency repairs/towing. Choose reliable RVs with solid review history.</p>
